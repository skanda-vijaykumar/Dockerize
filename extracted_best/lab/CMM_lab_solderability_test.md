## I. Introduction

### A. Purpose
The CMM connectors' family are manufactured to meet or exceed the requirements of MIL-DTL-55302G standard.

### B. Scope
to determine the solderability of all terminations which are normally joined by a soldering operation. 
This determination is made on the basis of the ability of these terminations
to be wetted by solder and the predictability of a suitable fillet resulting from solder application. 
These procedures will verify that the pre-assembly lead finish provides a solderable surface of 
sufficient quality to enable satisfactory soldering.

The following data has been taken from NICOMATIC Qualification test reports QTR0944.

### C. Conclusion
The CMM connectors' family are **qualified** regarding SOLDERABILITY according to MIL-DTL-55302G.

No physical damage to the termination or connectors resulting from soldering.

<!-- PAGE: 4 -->
### C. Test Method and Results

Flux shall be applied by a suitable method and allowed to drain for 5 to 20 seconds.

The solder shall be applied to the terminal along with the clean solder coated tip of an iron 

Unless otherwise specified in the individual specification, iron temperature shall be 350°C ± 5.5°C

The termination shall be positioned so that the iron can be applied to the test surface in a horizontal position 

Unless otherwise specified in the individual specification, the iron shall be applied for a period of 5 ±0.5 seconds and shall remain stationary during this period. 

the connectors are subjected to soldering operation at 350°C, according to MIL-DTL-55302F standard.& MIL-STD-202 Method 208 test procedure. 

No physical damage to the termination or connectors from soldering test qualification.
