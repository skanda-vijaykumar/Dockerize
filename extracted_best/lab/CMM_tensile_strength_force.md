## I. Introduction

### A. Purpose

The CMM connectors' family are manufactured to meet or exceed the requirements of MIL-DTL-55302G standard. Here we are also following WHMA-A-620B standard for requirements.

### B. Scope

To determine the mechanical strength of the crimped contact-to-conductor joint.

The following data has been taken from NICOMATIC Qualification test reports QTR0938, QTR0949, QTR0965, QTR1008, QTR1038, QTR1039, QTR1061, QTR1063, QTR1102, QTR1121 and QTR1414.

### C. Conclusion

The CMM connectors' family are qualified regarding CRIMP TENSILE STRENGTH FORCE (AWG12 to AWG28) according MIL-DTL-55302G and WHMA-A-620B.

### C. Test Method and Results

#### d. Test Procedure according to MIL-DTL-55302G

The test shall be performed in accordance with test procedure EIA-364-08. Samples for test shall be placed in a standard tensile testing machine and the load applied at an approximate rate as specified to pull the wire out of the sample or break the wire sample. Values shall be as shown in table IV. Note that these values are for NEMA HP3, type E wire used in conjunction with the proper crimp contact. Seven samples of each wire size (both pin and receptacle types) shall be tested.

#### e. Test Procedure according to EIA-364-08

- Place crimped sample into test fixture of tensile tester.
- Activate tensile equipment so that an axial force is exerted at a speed of 25 ± 6 millimetres per minute (1 ± ¼ inch per minute) until separation occurs between contact and conductor.
- Record tensile data and examine sample.
- Separation

Types of separation resulting from this test are as follows:
- Slip (pull out).
- Conductor broken in crimp area (some or all).
- Contact broke in crimp area (some or all).
- Conductor broken outside crimp area.
- Contact broken outside crimp area.
