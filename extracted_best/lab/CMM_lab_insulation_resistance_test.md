## I. Introduction

### A. Purpose

The CMM connectors' family are manufactured to meet or exceed the requirements of MIL-DTL-55302G standard.

### B. Scope

Measure the insulation resistance of CMM connectors equipped with LF and HP contacts.

The following data has been taken from NICOMATIC Qualification test report QTR0808.

### C. Conclusion

The CMM connectors' family are qualified regarding INSULATION RESISTANCE according to MIL-DTL-55302G.

LF & HP Contacts (all series): Insulation resistance > 400 GΩ

### B. Requirements

According to MIL-DTL-55302G standard and EIA-364-21C:

The initial insulation resistance shall be not less than 5,000 MΩ (5 GΩ).

### C. Test Method and Results

Insulation resistance is measured separately between the closest adjacent contacts and between pins and hardware.

The same contact locations for a given connector are used each time the insulation resistance test is performed.

Test voltage applied is 500 V DC ± 10%.
