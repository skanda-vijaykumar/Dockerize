## B. Requirements

According to MIL-DTL-83513GG standard and EIA-364-31B test procedure:

Connectors shall meet the applicable dielectric withstanding voltage and insulation resistance requirements.

The connectors shall be fully wired and mated. Then the connectors shall be subjected to testing in accordance with test procedure EIA-364-31, method IV (except steps 7a and 7b shall not be required). The following exceptions and details shall apply:

a. After the 24-hour conditioning period, the insulation resistance shall be measured.
*<!-- PAGE: 4 -->*
b. Upon completion of step 6 of the final cycle, connectors shall be removed from the chamber, unmated, and surface moisture removed from the inserts. Dielectric withstanding voltage test (sea level) and insulation resistance test shall be performed for all classes of connectors within 1 to 2 hours.

## C. Test Method and Results

### a. Withstanding Voltage Test

The Voltage is applied between the body of the connector and the nearest wire and between a central wire and a group of wire around this.

*Note: The original document contains a table showing test parameters with the following information:*

**Standard reference**: EIA-364-20C (for both Atmospheric pressure and 45mbar pressure)

**Voltage**:
- 30 contacts: 800 VDC (atmospheric) / 150 VDC (45mbar)
- 120 contacts: 600 VDC (atmospheric) / 150 VDC (45mbar)

**Application points**:
- 30 contacts: Between ground and nearest wire, Between a central wire and 5 wires around
- 120 contacts: Between ground and nearest wire, Between a central wire and 8 wires around

**Specimen configuration**: specimen not operating
**Ambient conditions**: Laboratory conditions

### b. Insulation Resistance Measurement Test

The Voltage is applied between the body of the sensor and all the outputs wires of the sensitive element. The test voltage applied is 500V DC / Duration 60s.

### c. Humidity Test

EIA-364-31B prescriptions are respected.

A polarizing potential is applied on the couple of connectors.

- The minimum temperature is 25°C and the maximum temperature is 65°C.
- The minimum relative humidity is 89 ± 9% and the maximum relative humidity is 94 ± 4%.

The climatic cycle is defined below:

*Note: The original document contains a temperature and humidity cycle graph showing the 16-hour cycle with temperature ranging from 25°C to 65°C and relative humidity ranging from approximately 60% to 90%*
