<!-- PAGE: 2 -->
## I. Introduction

### A. Purpose

The CMM connectors' family are manufactured to meet or exceed the requirements of MIL-DTL-55302G standard.

### B. Scope

Determine the Mating and Unmating force of a CMM connector, equipped with LF and/or HP contacts, to its intended mating connector.

The following data has been taken from NICOMATIC Qualification test report QTR0809a.

### C. Conclusion

The CMM connectors' family are **qualified** regarding MATING and UNMATING force according to MIL-DTL-55302G.

| | Mating force<br>(per contact) | Unmating<br>(per contact) |
|---|---|---|
| LF Contacts | 2.7 N max | 0.2 N min |
| HP 22 Series | 2.7 N max | 0.2 N min |
| HP 30 Series | 6 N max | 1 N max |

### B. Requirements

According to MIL-DTL-55302G standard and EIA-364-13D test procedure:

No requirements available.

### C. Test Method and Results

After 3 unmonitored cycles of insertion and withdrawal, the force required to fully insert and withdraw a plug from the receptacle shall be measured.

#### Mating force

The two mating connectors shall be brought to a position where mechanical mating begins and the force or torque gage is at zero indication.

The connectors shall then be fully mated or coupled at a rate of 25.4 millimeters/minute, unless otherwise specified in the referencing document, and the peak force or torque required for mating shall be recorded.

#### Unmating force

The mated connectors shall be fully unmated at a rate of 25.4 millimeters/minute, unless otherwise specified in the referencing document, and the peak force or torque required shall be recorded.
