## I. Introduction

### A. Purpose
The CMM connectors' family are manufactured to meet or exceed the requirements of MIL-DTL-55302G standard.

### B. Scope
The object of this test is to determine the effects of sinusoidal vibration within the predominant vibration frequency ranges and magnitudes that may be encountered during the life of the connector.

The following data has been taken from NICOMATIC Qualification test report QTR0935a. 

### C. Conclusion
The CMM connectors' family are qualified regarding VIBRATION according to MIL-DTL-55302G.

Vibration test according to MIL-DTL-55302F Test Condition III 147.1 m/s2 (15 gn) peak

### B. Requirements
According to MIL-DTL-55302G standard and EIA-364-28E test condition III:
- No physical or mechanical damage to the connector body or contacts
- During vibration there shall be no interruption in continuity greater than one microsecond of the test circuit, which incorporates mated contacts
- After the vibration test, the mounting hardware shall show no signs of loosening, fracture or other deterioration
- Vibration conditions shall be in accordance with the following conditions (condition III):

| Test condition | Frequency Range Hz | Peak level |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ---------- |
| III High | 10 Hz to 2000 Hz | 15 gn / 147.1 m/s² |

### C. Test Method and Results

**Amplitude:**
The specimens shall be subjected to a simple harmonic motion having an amplitude of either 1.52 mm (0.06 in) double amplitude (maximum total excursion) or 147.1 m/s2 (15 gn) peak, whichever is less. The tolerance on vibration amplitude shall be ±10%.

**Frequency range:**
The vibration frequency shall be varied logarithmically between the approximate limits of 10 Hz to 2,000 Hz except that the procedure of this standard may be applied during the 10 Hz to 55 Hz band of the vibration frequency range.

**Sweep time and duration:**
The entire frequency range of 10 Hz to 2,000 Hz and return to 10 Hz shall be traversed in 20 minutes. This cycle shall be performed 12 times in each of three mutually perpendicular directions (total of 36 times), so that the motion shall be applied for a total period of approximately 12 hours. Interruptions are permitted provided the requirements for rate of change and test duration are met. Completion of cycling within any separate band is permissible before going to the next band. When the procedure of this standard is used for the 10 Hz to 55 Hz band, the duration of this portion shall be the same as the duration for this band using logarithmic cycling (approximately 1-1/3 hours in each of three mutually perpendicular directions).
