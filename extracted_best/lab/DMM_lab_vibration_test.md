## I. Introduction

### A. Purpose

The DMM connectors' family are manufactured to meet or exceed the requirements of MIL-DTL-83513G standard.

### B. Scope

The object of this test is to determine the effects of sinusoidal vibration within the predominant vibration frequency ranges and magnitudes that may be encountered during the life of the connector.

The following data has been taken from NICOMATIC Qualification test reports QTR1593a and QTR1594a.

### C. Conclusion

The DMM Connector with only contacts LF are **qualified** regarding VIBRATION test according to MIL-DTL-85513G standard.

The DMM Connector containing contacts HP are **qualified** regarding VIBRATION test according to NICOMATIC SPEC. SHEET. & "EIA/ECA-364-28E test procedure" condition III: 15G / (Internal requirement for HP connector).

For HP contacts: Vibration test according to NICOMATIC SPEC. SHEET Test Condition III 147.1 m/s2 (15 gn) peak]

For LF contacts: Vibration test according to MIL-DTL-83513G Test Condition IV 196.1 m/s2 (20 gn) peak]

*[Note: The PDF contains images of 12 different connector test sample pairs with descriptions]*

### B. Requirements

According to MIL-DTL-83513G standard and EIA-364-28E test condition III and IV:

- No physical or mechanical damage to the connector body or contacts
- During vibration there shall be **no interruption in continuity greater than one microsecond** of the test circuit, which incorporates mated contacts
- After the vibration test, the mounting hardware shall show no signs of loosening, fracture or other deterioration

- Vibration conditions shall be in accordance with the following conditions:

| Test condition | Frequency Range Hz | Peak level ||
|----------------|-------------------|-----------|------|
| | | gn | m/s² |
| III | High 10 Hz to 2000 Hz | 15 | 147.1 |
| IV | High 10 Hz to 2000 Hz | 20 | 196.1 |

### C. Test Method and Results

The connector assembly shall be mounted as specified herein and vibrated in accordance with test procedure EIA-364-28, condition IV.

All contacts shall be wired in series with at least 100 milliamperes of current allowed to flow.

A suitable instrument shall be employed to monitor the current flow and to indicate any discontinuity of contact or interruption of current flow.

**Amplitude:**

The specimens shall be subjected to a simple harmonic motion having an amplitude of either 1.52 mm (0.06 in) double amplitude (maximum total excursion) or 147.1 m/s² (15 gn) peak or 196.1 m/s² (20gn), whichever is less. The tolerance on vibration amplitude shall be ±10%.

**Frequency range:**

The vibration frequency shall be varied logarithmically between the approximate limits of 10 Hz to 2,000 Hz except that the procedure of this standard may be applied during the 10 Hz to 55 Hz band of the vibration frequency range.

**Sweep time and duration:**

The entire frequency range of 10 Hz to 2,000 Hz and return to 10 Hz shall be traversed in 20 minutes. This cycle shall be performed 12 times in each of three mutually perpendicular directions (total of 36 times), so that the motion shall be applied for a total period of approximately 12 hours. Interruptions are permitted provided the requirements for rate of change and test duration are met. Completion of cycling within any separate band is permissible before going to the next band. When the procedure of this standard is used for the 10 Hz to 55 Hz band, the duration of this portion shall be the same as the duration for this band using logarithmic cycling (approximately 1-1/3 hours in each of three mutually perpendicular directions).
