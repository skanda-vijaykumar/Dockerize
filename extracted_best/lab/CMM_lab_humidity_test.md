## I. Introduction

### A. Purpose

The CMM connectors' family are manufactured to meet or exceed the requirements of MIL-DTL-55302G standard.

### B. Scope

The object of this test is to assess the ability of electrical components to withstand severities of humidity test.

The following data has been taken from NICOMATIC Qualification test reports QTR0943 and QTR0945.

### C. Conclusion

The CMM connectors' family are **qualified** regarding HUMIDITY according to MIL-DTL-55302G.

Humidity test according to MIL-DTL-55302 _ 7 days.

### B. Requirements

According to MIL-DTL-55302G standard and EIA-364-31B test procedure:

When tested in accordance with test method, insulation resistance shall be greater than 1,000 megohms.
<!-- PAGE: 4 -->
### C. Test Method and Results

The Connectors are assembled by pair.

A polarizing potential is applied on the couple of connectors.
- The minimum temperature is 25°C and the maximum temperature is 65°C.
- The minimum relative humidity is 89 ± 9% and the maximum relative humidity is 94 ± 4%.

The climatic cycle is defined below:

![Temperature and Relative Humidity Graph showing cycle over 16 hours]

- Before and after humidity test, connectors are tested in accordance with MIL-DTL-55302F & EIA/ECA-364-21C test procedure.
- Insulation resistance are measured separately between the closest adjacent contacts and between pins and hardware. The test voltages applied are 500Vdc.
