<!-- PAGE: 2 -->

## I. Introduction

### A. Purpose

The CMM connectors' family are manufactured to meet or exceed the requirements of MIL-DTL-55302G standard.

### B. Scope

Check if the male and female contacts can refused to be mated with oversized pins or rings without being damaged.

The following data has been taken from NICOMATIC Qualification test report QTR0802.

### C. Conclusion

The CMM connectors' family are **qualified** regarding OVERSIZED PIN EXCLUSION according to MIL-DTL-55302G.

### B. Requirements

According to MIL-DTL-55302G standard:

The mating end of the socket contacts shall exclude the entry of a test pin 0.005 inch larger than the allowable maximum pin diameter in the connector when tested in accordance with test method.

### C. Test Method and Results

The applicable steel pin, shown on figure 2, for the size contacts to be tested, shall be applied to the sockets of the connector for a period of 10-seconds without the pin entering the socket or causing damage to the socket. A minimum of seven contacts shall be measured on each specimen.
