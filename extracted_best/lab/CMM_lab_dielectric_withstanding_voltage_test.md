*21.12.16*

## I. Introduction

### A. Purpose

The CMM connectors' family are manufactured to meet or exceed the requirements of MIL-DTL-55302G standard.

### B. Scope

Measure the breakdown voltage of electrical connectors equipped with LF and/or HP contacts in order to specify withstanding and rated voltage at sea level and at 70 000 ft.

The following data has been taken from NICOMATIC Qualification test reports QTR0807 and QTR0810.

### C. Conclusion

The CMM connectors' family are **qualified** regarding WITHSTANDING VOLTAGE AT SEA LEVEL and AT HIGH ALTITUDE (70 000 ft) according to MIL-DTL-55302G.

### B. Requirements

According to MIL-DTL-55302G standard and EIA-364-20C test procedure method A:

**Dielectric withstanding Voltage (sea level)**: 500 Volts RMS (AC), 60 Hz. Connectors shall show no evidence of breakdown or flashover.

**Dielectric withstanding Voltage (70 000 ft)**: 100 Volts RMS (AC), 60 Hz. Connectors shall show no evidence of breakdown or flashover.
<!-- PAGE: 4 -->
### C. Test Method and Results

An increasing AC Voltage was applied at a rate of approximately 500 Volts RMS per second between the closest contacts, and between the fixation and the closest contact, until either breakdown or flashover occurred.

For purposes of standardization, the withstanding voltage shall be established as 75% of the minimum breakdown voltage of the connector, and it is suggested that the operating rated voltage of the connector be established as 1/3 of the withstanding voltage.
