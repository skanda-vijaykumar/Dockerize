## HF / Coax Contact
**RF or high speed data Up to 20 Ghz**

**Nicomatic High Frequency**

contacts are suitable for a frequency bandwidth from 400MHz to 11GHz.

Turned in house on Swiss screw machining machines, they are then assembled with an outside clip in order to make the insertion in the housing easier.

The design and simulation of the contacts was handled as part of a strong partnership European research laboratory. We provide a full range of contacts compatible with numerous cables while keeping the same pitch and cavity design.

Nicomatic is now able to provide you with RF harnesses made with flexible and semi-rigid cable and delivered with a test report. By keeping the 4 mm pitch between contacts it will definitely meet high density expectations.

## DMM / Assembly Line
**We combine a major & unique know how**

Nicomatic has auto-mated the assembly of shell and insulator.

An epoxy resin is dispensed between the insulator and shell by a fully automated, three axis machine. After polymerization the epoxy becomes solid and acts as a mechanical key. The resulting insert retention is five times higher than the MIL-DTL-83513G requirements.

You need a custom shape? Or want to add a personal engraving? Do you need to change your contacts layout? Or change the pitch? Contact us, we can help as part of our in-house services!

## EMI / Key concerns
**Electromagnetic interference**
**Effective shielding**

**Nicomatic Know-how**

The increasing amount of data in electronic systems can have a disastrous result if the impact of cross talk is not anticipated.

In the event of electromagnetic interference (EMI, RFI or EMP), the cable's conductor acts like an antenna and picks up the radiated signals. The reception of this interference will inevitably affect the integrity of the initial signal. Today, data rate is increasing exponentially and high-speed protocols are omnipresent. A proper shielding features as a key part of the design.

The backshell as a rear part of the NICOMATIC DMM MIL-DTL-83513G connector is used to secure the cable and to avoid stresses to the soldered/crimped part of the contact. It also shields against electrical interference (EMI/RFI protection) with Transfer Impedance (Zt) under 200mOhm from 10 KHz to 400Mhz (compliant with MIL-STD-1377 (screened cable/connector method). Made of Aluminium 6061 with chemical nickel finish, it protects from mechanical damages.

The back chimneys are designed in an ellipse shape that is fully compatible with common banding systems. Bands and clamping hand tools are available on our website. Openings allow wires to be fastened with a band clamp system and also to ground the shielding of the twisted pair cable. There are 2 backshell designs available, split and mono.

The split backshell is fully compatible with all Nicomatic DMM connectors, and designed as a two-piece shell. The fixing hardware is mounted on the connector and the locking of the two parts of the shell does not interfere with the harness which is made independently in a previous stage. This means that the hardware is quick and easy to assemble.

The mono backshell is fully compatible with all Nicomatic DMM connectors. Given that it is lighter and smaller, it is a smart and cost-effective solution for the series stage.

The flange has a strong impact on EMI performance in case of panel mounting. As it fills the space between the panel cut and the connector, it greatly improves attenuation (up to 15dB). The chart on the next page represents the attenuation according to the IEEE-STD-299-1997 (Standard Method for Measuring the Effectiveness of Electromagnetic Shielding Enclosures).

In the same way, EMI O-Ring DMM, as an evolution of the DMM flange, provides advanced performance for extreme requirements. For more information, please consult our "Exclusive DMM pages". (P.76)

## Metalised composite / DLMM
**Lighter - Cost control | Large EMI protection**
**Rugged body armor | Lead-time 3 weeks**

**Alternative solution**

Today, Nicomatic can offer you the best of the innovation on micro-modular connector market. A metalized composite MicroD/microd connector: The DLMM.

We all know that every ounce in weight matters and our DLMM is definitely lighter than an aluminium connector. It actually weights 20% less than the DMM and 40% less than a Backshell. How to achieve such high performance? We use an ULTEM composite shell, which also helps to reduce the cost of manufacturing and is less expensive than a standard MicroD/microd connector and reduces the lead time up to 3 weeks.

Indeed, metalization acts as a strong body armor to protect the DLMM. Qualified in compliance with MIL-DTL-83513G and tested under radio frequency interferences. Thanks to its copper underlayer, it guarantees high EMI protection, identical to our standard DMM.

## With Elodie

## Screw-machining specialist

Without doubt, contacts & fixings are some of the most crucial parts of a connector. We met with Elodie, one of our young screw-machining specialists.

**Inside Nicomatic**

As an expert in Mechanics and Mathematics, a screw machinist is a specialist who can make various kinds of miniature pieces used in different sectors characterised by harsh environments:
Aeronautics, automotive, electronics, optical, medical etc.

This profession requires a high degree of precision and good work methods.
Screw machinists make real elements and products from drawings.
They turn the ideas of the engineers into reality. It's impressive to see how they transform raw materials into real products: From a steelbar to a connector fixing for example.

Like engineers who develop users' environments to offer the most suitable solution, machining operators need to take into account all external environments in order to produce the perfect parts.

This kind of precision has always interested Elodie, our young machining operator: "My dream is to become screw machining expert and easily produce all kind of miniature parts and help other people to learn this profession.

I arrived few years ago as a young operator on combined work-study contract. I learned among passionate people who shared their experience and skills with me every day.However, given that I had just finished my studies in microtechnology and my team members had at least 10 years of experience in this domain, it was very difficult at the beginning.
I had to work hard to establish myself and gain recognition in the male-dominated world of screw machining and even from my team. In my team, I think we are all equal, we wear the same shirt, we work on the same machines and we can count on each other."

I'm very confident for my future. I would like to continue developing among the best specialists to help other new arrivals like myself a few years ago, to teach them my know-how and tips for screw machining."

## With Priscilla

## Machining manager

A plant is a never-ending procession, livened up by the coming and going of people and activities.
To manage this continual flow and maintain a very high level of quality and performance, we need different talents and strong personalities. Let's meet Pricilla, manager of the screw machining department.

**Inside Nicomatic**

Technology studies were an obvious choice for me. Since I was a kid, I have always loved complex devices and electronics and handling them. Today I have lost count of how many alarm clocks, radios and other electronic devices that I have taken apart and assembled again, not always successfully. It drove my parents crazy! Technology was and still is my passion! That's why I chose my studies curriculum/orientation in industrial design of electronics and micro-technology. First I discovered a magic world of extraordinary machines and high tech.
I was particularly interested in high tech and innovation.

This is good news for me, given that we produce the following fabulous products in the machining department: miniaturised elements that are the fruit of hours of work and thinking beforehand, involving the entire team. The teamwork and human relations is the second passion I discovered during my studies. Being naturally curious and because I needed a summer job, I obtained a summer camp activity leader certification (BAFA/BAFD).
This gave me the basic elements I needed for project and team management and the desire to associate both management and technology in my professional life. That's why I chose to do a master's degree in Industry management. As a woman, it is often difficult to find our place in the male-dominated world of industry. We have to prove our expertise and work 3 times harder at it. However, even if there are not many women in this profession, they show that the passion for the work is not related to gender! It proves that if we like our job and want to use our expertise in the industrial sector, we can do it. Because the world is changing and people's visions are, too. Here, at Nicomatic, the general mindset had changed even before my arrival. Today I'm proud to be a woman and a young manager, that I was trusted to manage 3 mini-plants on Nicomatic's production line.

For me, being a manager means being demanding with myself before being demanding with others. Details are very important as we are producing elements for very challenging and secure environments. We have to keep an eye on everything to avoid any errors. However being manager is also about coaching our teams.
We should be present when people need us and help them achieve their personal aspirations. As success cannot be achieved without a team and talented people.

If I would like my team to give the best of themselves, I should be be exemplary in their eyes, live with them, be close to them, listen to their needs, understand their problems and make their lives easier.
For me the human aspect is a key part of success of our organization.

## EN 9100
**Standard of excellence**
**Quality without compromise**
**Dedicated to exception**

In order to meet requirements of the such safety-conscious industries as the aerospace and defense sectors, we are committed to EN9100 & ISO 9001 certification to build our quality system.

Strict quality control of all steps from product design to delivery guarantees our clients compliant products that are adapted to their needs and industry requirements.

This quality standard is one of the most demanding and difficult schemes to put in place and respect in daily operations. Nicomatic however were certified from the creation of this quality system management standard (2009).

Thanks to the high standard of Nicomatic's organisation, it can focus on ensuring the highest quality and specifications of its products and services. As for us, excellence cannot be attained by making concessions. We continue progressing and improving our organisation to offer the best of ourselves to all ourcustomers.

All Nicomatic employees are experts; they are delighted to show their work and their know-how to all our customers. We are trying to create a favourable environment for them to work in, build new solutions together and fulfill thier professional dreams.

Consequently, this year we renewed our certification (new 2016 version).

What's different?
Some domains were reinforced in the standard certification such as:
- Supply chain and purchasing. We are building and managing long term relationship with not only our cutomers but also with our suppliers and intermediaries.
- Anti-Counterfeiting. We make excellent products with secure, REACH & ROHS raw materials. We work alongside our suppliers to continuously improve our common creations and quality.
- Human factor and skills. This factor is in the centre of our organisation. We pay particular attention to the human skills to capitalising on human skills and developing talent. We also work to minimize human error risks management.

Obtaining the new version of this certification was a challenge for Nicomatic and its teams in 2017. However we didn't hesitate to take up this challenge. Why?
Because innovation is a part of our genetic make-up and we have a pioneer spirit to be listed among first companies getting this certification. So we started this new challenge and worked hard together to improve our organization and get the certification.

Today people are very proud of their common success.

*Bulk kits for fixing hardware can be delivered on request.*

**TIPS**:
1. In case of thicker PCB, we can easily manufacture longer fixings.
2. If one connector is mounted with a jackpost fixing, its mating must be mounted with a jackscrew fixing.
3. If one connector is mounted with guide socket fixing, its mating must be mounted with guide pin.
4. Fixings are delivered mounted on the connector.
5. A controlled torque screw driver kit is available, please refer to the tooling page.

**TIPS**:
1. In case of a thicker PCB, we can easily manufacture a longer fixing.
2. If one connector is mounted with a jackpost fixing, its mating must be mounted with a jackscrew fixing.
3. If one connector is mounted with guide socket fixing, its mating must be mounted with guide pin.
4. Fixings are delivered mounted on the connector.
5. A controlled torque screwdriver kit is available, please refer to the tooling page.

### OPTIONS

#### FLEXIBLE PCB ASSEMBLY

In a lot of applications today, you can choose to switch from round cable to flat flexible PCB in order to save weight & space.

In this way, we can support you full Flexible PCB Assembly to avoid the multi-suppliers risk. Working with multilple layers and/or shielded flexible support, we can simulate and qualify the signal integrity of such harnesses. Please feel free to contact us.

<!-- PAGE: 72 -->
## BACKSHELL

### CHOOSE YOUR TYPE → MONO OR SPLIT

They all are made of Aluminium 6061 + 20µ of chemical nickel finishing.

As a rear part of the DMM they bring you:
- Mechanical protection, thereby avoiding tension on the wires and the contact soldering/crimping
- 360° shielding against EMI/RFI (according to MIL-STD-1377) with a transfer impedance (Zt) under 200mOhm from 10kHz to 400mHz.
- Compatible with Band-it type systems

**TIPS**: 90° or 45° Chimney? Custom design? Grounding advice? Please feel free to contact us, we are well-experienced
